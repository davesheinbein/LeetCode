/*
Explanation:

This problem is a typical greedy approach where we need to distribute candies to children based on their ratings while satisfying certain conditions. The conditions are:

1. Each child must receive at least one candy.
2. Children with higher ratings should receive more candies than their neighbors.

The solution is broken down into two passes over the ratings array:

1. Left to Right Pass:
   - We start by giving each child one candy.
   - As we iterate through the list, we check if the current child has a higher rating than the previous one.
   - If so, we increase their candy count to be one more than the previous childâ€™s candy count.
   - This ensures that children with higher ratings than their left neighbor receive more candies.

2. Right to Left Pass:
   - After the left to right pass, we perform another pass from right to left.
   - This ensures that children with higher ratings than their right neighbor get more candies, while respecting the candy distribution from the first pass.
   - If a child has a higher rating than the next one, we update their candy count to be the maximum of their current candy count or one more than the next child's candy count.

Finally, the total number of candies is the sum of all elements in the `candyDistribution` array.

Time Complexity:
   - O(n): We make two passes through the array, where `n` is the number of children (i.e., the length of the `ratings` array).

Space Complexity:
   - O(n): We use an array `candyDistribution` to store the candy count for each child, which requires space proportional to the number of children.

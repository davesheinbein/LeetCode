/**
   Explanation:
 
  1. **Definition of a window**:
     - A **window** refers to a contiguous segment of the array defined by two pointers: 
       the `left` pointer (start of the window) and the `right` pointer (end of the window).
     - The elements within the window are those between the `left` and `right` indices, inclusive.

  2. **How the window works**:
     - The `right` pointer expands the window by including new elements from the array into the sum.
     - The `left` pointer shrinks the window by excluding elements from the sum when the condition (sum >= target) is met.
     - This dynamic adjustment ensures the algorithm considers all possible valid subarrays efficiently.

  3. **Algorithm steps**:
     - Start with an empty window (`left = 0` and `right = 0`) and a `sum = 0`.
     - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and adding elements to `sum`.
     - If the `sum` of the window meets or exceeds the `target`, calculate the window's length (`right - left + 1`).
     - Update `minLength` if the current window is shorter than the previously found windows.
     - Shrink the window by moving the `left` pointer forward and subtracting the excluded element from `sum`.
     - Continue until the entire array is processed.

  4. **Final result**:
     - If no valid subarray is found (i.e., `minLength` remains `Infinity`), return 0.
     - Otherwise, return the smallest length found.

  Time Complexity: O(n) - Each element is visited at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).
  Space Complexity: O(1) - Only constant space is used.

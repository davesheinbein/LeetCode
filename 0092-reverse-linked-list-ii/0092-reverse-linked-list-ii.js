Explanation:

1. Dummy Node:
   - A dummy node is introduced to simplify edge cases like when the reversal starts at the head of the list (i.e., `left = 1`).
   - The `dummy.next` points to the actual head of the modified list after the reversal.

2. Reversing the Sublist:
   - We first move `prev` to the node just before the `left` position.
   - We reverse the sublist between positions `left` and `right` by repeatedly moving the `then` node to the front of the sublist, adjusting the `next` pointers accordingly.

3. Edge Cases:
   - If `left === right`, we don't need to reverse any nodes because the sublist is just one node long.
   - The dummy node simplifies the case where the reversal starts from the head of the list (i.e., `left = 1`).

4. Final Result:
   - The function returns `dummy.next`, which is the head of the modified list after the reversal.

Time Complexity:
- O(n): We traverse the list twice: once to move `prev` to the `left` position and once to reverse the sublist. Each traversal is O(n), so the time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.

Space Complexity:
- O(1): The reversal is done in-place, with only a few additional pointers used for the process. Therefore, the space complexity is O(1) excluding the input and output.

**How the Original List is Updated During Reversal:**

Hereâ€™s how the nodes in the list are modified during the reversal process:

Initial List:
Let's say the list is: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
If `left = 2` and `right = 4`, the portion of the list we want to reverse is from position 2 to position 4, i.e., `2 -> 3 -> 4`.

Step 1: Initialize `prev`, `start`, and `then`

Before the reversal, we have:
- `prev`: points to node `1`.
- `start`: points to node `2`.
- `then`: points to node `3`.

Step 2: Reversal Process
For each iteration, the `then` node will be moved to the front of the sublist, and the `next` pointers will be updated accordingly.

First Iteration (i = 0):
- `start.next = then.next` (link `2 -> 4`)
- `then.next = prev.next` (link `3 -> 2`)
- `prev.next = then` (link `1 -> 3`)
- Now, `then = start.next` points to node `4`.

List after the first iteration:
- `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5`

Second Iteration (i = 1):
- `start.next = then.next` (link `2 -> 5`)
- `then.next = prev.next` (link `4 -> 3`)
- `prev.next = then` (link `1 -> 4`)
- Now, `then = start.next` points to node `5`.

List after the second iteration:
- `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`

Step 3: Return the Modified List
The sublist `2 -> 3 -> 4` has been reversed to `4 -> 3 -> 2`, and the final list is:
- `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`

The function returns `dummy.next`, which points to the head of the modified list: `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5`.
